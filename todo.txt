set minimum of add, mult... to 2

make abs sym that can replace associative (ex. -> can replace a+b in a+b+c if rule is x_ + c)

make num exp convertable to lambda (numexp has lam(self) function)

Function shoudl extends NumExp, Mapping

in assoc exp work on identity elements

make sure that u can use same AbsSym multiple time in comparison expr (and it has one value throughout)

in assoc comparison fix when there are 2 abssym next to each other (first takes 1 element, second others)
